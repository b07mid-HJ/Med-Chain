# MedChain - Revolutionizing Healthcare with Blockchain

Welcome to MedChain, a groundbreaking project aimed at transforming healthcare accessibility through the power of Flutter for the front-end and Solidity/Ethereum for the blockchain.

## Overview

MedChain is a decentralized healthcare platform that leverages blockchain technology to ensure secure, interoperable, and real-time access to electronic health records. With a user-friendly Flutter-based front-end, MedChain caters to various user roles, including admin, doctor, nurse, and patient, providing a tailored experience for each.

## Features

### 1. Decentralized Electronic Health Records (EHR)
- Utilizing Ethereum blockchain, MedChain ensures tamper-resistant and secure storage of electronic health records.
- Each user has a unique identity, and their health records are accessible only through secure authentication.

### 2. Interoperable Communication Hub
- The Flutter-based front-end facilitates seamless communication among healthcare professionals and patients.
- Standardized data exchange protocols ensure compatibility and ease of communication.

### 3. Emergency Access Protocol
- A dedicated protocol allows immediate access to critical health information during emergencies.
- Emergency workers can retrieve essential data, such as allergies and medications, for informed decision-making.

### 4. Role-Based Access Control
- Admin, doctor, nurse, and patient roles are defined, each with specific permissions.
- Smart contracts govern access control, ensuring that sensitive data is only accessible to authorized individuals.
